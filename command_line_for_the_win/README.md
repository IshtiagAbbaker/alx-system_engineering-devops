Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a network protocol that provides a secure and encrypted method for transferring files between computers. It is an extension of the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol and operates over a secure channel, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data during transmission. SFTP is commonly used for secure file management, enabling users to upload, download, and manage files on remote servers in a secure manner. Unlike traditional FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SFTP encrypts both commands and data, preventing unauthorized access and eavesdropping. This protocol is widely adopted in various contexts, including web hosting, system administration, and data exchange between organizations, where the protection of sensitive information during file transfer is crucial. SFTP is a reliable and widely supported protocol that plays a significant role in ensuring the secure exchange of files across the internet.
